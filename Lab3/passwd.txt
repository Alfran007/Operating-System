      a) The command shown in the pic gives the owners name which is root itself.
      
      What I observed:
      b) We are only allowed to change only our password inspite of having effective user id of root because at the time of
      password change the real user id is checked not the effective user id . We can only change the effective user id and
      not the real user id.
      
      We can't change other passwords because the program won't allow us to. The program has system permissions to change any 
      password it wants, because it is running as root, but the program has been specifically designed not to give the user
      any way to get it to use those permissions  

      When a normal user wants to make change to the passwd file, the user will by setuid be given the effective user access. 
      User becomes root temporarily and can edit passwd.
      
      Moreover, even if user does sudo which changes eff uid(EUID) to root the real uid stays the same and don't given access
