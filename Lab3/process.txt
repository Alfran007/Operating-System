a) 

Location of fork.c

	pic : Attached

	go to linux version 

	i.e.

	cd linux-4.9.5 from Desktop

	now enter:
	select all  ". pro\*" 

	now grep the file using grep.c
	so command would be
	find . pro\* | grep fork.c

	Exact location :
	~/Downloads/linux-4.9.5/kernel$ find -name fork.c

      
Location of do_fork();

	pic : Attached

	go to kernel folder

	now in the fork.c file
	find do_fork() defination

	get the line numbers of starting and ending and print it on the screen using
	in ~/Downloads/linux-4.9.5$ 
	sed -n 1907,1977p fork.c

Location of sys_fork():

	pic : Attached
	
	path :~/Downloads/linux-4.9.5$ gedit arch/m68k/kernel/entry.S

	sys_fork is redefined in modern versions of linux, it is in assembly and the pic of assembly is also attached with the file location 		pics.

	In fork.c there is a function do_fork() which is called by sys_fork() which i present in process.c and is in assembly.
	so whenwe call fork.c it calls the function sys_fork() which further clls do_fork() to genereate a child process and a unique process 		ID.

c)
	File attached : tree.txt

	Command to list all makes in source tree and put in a file.
	tree -I "makefile" > tree.txt
