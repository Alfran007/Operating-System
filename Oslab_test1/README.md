In This Test I made two function which are processes which runs in synchronisation.
In follows mutual exclusion .
When one process is executing in critical section after that it unsets it's flag.
When it is called it sets it ans turn is settes for another process after each process execution.
I made a loop to call these functions and did condition checking.
